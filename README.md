My coding challenge!!
I am happy to have had the opportunity to participate in this coding challenge. Considering the limited time we had, I made a decision to focus more on the back end of the challenge. 
I created the necessary data structure, with objects, repository, and interface. I chose to use them because I thought it would be handy if we were to upscale the app. 
For example, EmployerInterface could be implemented by JuniorHrEmployer, SeniorHrEmployer, and others who might have the same behavior.

I worked with JSP files and WebServlet for the internet connectivity. 
For the database, I began working with PostgreSQL, since it's what I have used until now, and encountered an installation problem along the way.

Regarding the Figma design, today was my first time using it, so it was exciting to work with and learn a new tool. Unfortunately, only after a lot of work did I start using the developer mode, 
so I think I lost a lot of time before. 

If you have the time, I would appreciate a feedback of my work, as this is the best way to learn - through feedback and collaboration.

Best regards.
